# Vehicle-counting-with-image-processing
The vehicle detection and tracking system using YOLOv11 and the SORT algorithm can identify cars in video streams in real time and assign a unique ID to each one. By combining accurate object detection with motion prediction, it is widely used in applications such as traffic monitoring, vehicle counting, and smart surveillance systems.
